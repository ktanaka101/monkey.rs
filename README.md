## Summury

We can learn how to make an interpreter in this book.  
====> ☆☆☆  __["Writing An Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/)__  ☆☆☆  
That interpreter is Monkey.  
In the book the Moneky interpreter is written in Go.  
But in this repository it is written in Rust.  

Caution!! Since I wrote Rust for the first time, the source code for this repository may not be the best practice.
