## Summury

We can learn how to make an interpreter in this book.  
====> ☆☆☆  __["Writing An Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/)__  ☆☆☆  
====> ☆☆☆  __["Writing A Compiler In Go"](https://compilerbook.com/)__  ☆☆☆  
That interpreter and compiler-VM is called Monkey in the book.  
The Monkey is written in Go in the book.  
But in this repository it is written in Rust.
