## Summury

Monkey is for ["Writing An Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/).

In the book the Moneky interpreter is written by Go.
But in this repository it is written in Rust.

Caution!! Since I wrote Rust for the first time, the source code for this repository may not be the best practice.
